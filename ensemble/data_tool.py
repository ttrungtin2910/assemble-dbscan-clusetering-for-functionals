def create_similarity_matrix(lst):
    """
    Creates a similarity matrix based on a given list, where elements with a 
    value of -1 are considered similar to each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lst : list or np.ndarray
        A 1D array or list containing integer values. The value -1 is treated as 
        a marker for similarity between elements.

    Returns
    -------
    upper_triangle_matrix : np.ndarray
        A 2D binary matrix of shape (n, n), where n is the length of the input list.
        The matrix is upper triangular, with 1 indicating similarity (both elements 
        are -1) and 0 elsewhere. The diagonal elements are set to 0.

    Notes
    -----
    - The input list is first converted to a NumPy array for vectorized operations.
    - The similarity is computed as a boolean condition:
        - `lst[i] == lst[j]` and `lst[i] == -1`
    - The resulting matrix is restricted to its upper triangular part, including the 
        diagonal initially, but the diagonal elements are set to 0 afterwards.
